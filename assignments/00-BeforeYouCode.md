# Before you start
* Make sure you started by reading the  [README](https://github.com/konstantinnovation/SummerAssignmentAPCS/blob/main/README.md)
* Any Windows10+/Mac/Linux computer will be sufficient to do all of the work in this course. Chromebooks and IPads are not sufficient.

# Show all file extensions
Your computer most likely hides the file extension from you when you look at file names on your computer.
Hello.txt just looks like Hello and the icon is a text file.

# Java Development Kit
* The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the software required for you to run and test java programs.
* Go to https://adoptium.net/ then download and install **Temurin 21 (LTS)** and click latest rlease to download the correct version.
* If for some reason you want to use another version of java for other purposes, you can, but it will potentially cause problems. If you do not use the same version as everyone else for this class then any problems that occur because of this will be entirely your fault.


# Text Editor
* If you are going to write your first Java program you will need a plain text editor. 
* Any PLAIN TEXT editor will work, but some are better than others. Windows users should NOT use "notepad" as it is the most barebones option available. Instead they can opt to download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). 

* [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) is the continuation of the popular editor Atom.   
  * It can be downloaded here [https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html)

* We will also have [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) installed in the labs. Note: VSCodium is identical to VS Code with the single biggest difference: VSCodium doesn't track your usage data. You can [learn more about it here](https://itsfoss.com/vscodium/)
  * This is more complex than Pulsar.
  * You can [download vscodium from here](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases) (Be careful to choose the correct download item)
    * Note that the exact version number (1.x.y.z) is 1.8ish right now but will change over time. The format around the version should be the same.
    * For windows you want the x64 msi file such as "VSCodium-x64-1.x.y.z.msi"  
    * For mac you want the x64 dmg file (OR arm64 if you have an M1 chip) such as "VSCodium.x64.1.x.y.z.dmg" OR "VSCodium.arm64.1.x.y.z.dmg"
    * For linux users, you probably need the x64 tar.gz such as "VSCodium-linux-x64-1.x.y.z.tar.gz"




# Command Line Interface

* Now you will be using a terminal, this is a command line interface (CLI) to your computer.
* In Windows the terminal is called "command prompt" or "cmd", on linux and Mac it is just Terminal. Learning about your terminal is beyond the scope of the preliminary coursework, but it is enough to know that your terminal needs to know which directory your files are in before it can use those files. We will use a shortcut for now by opening the terminal in the correct directory automatically.
* Directory - a listing of files and other directories. Your operating system probably makes them look like "folders", and you may hear them refered to as such. 
* [How to open a terminal in a particular directory](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/) For windows, just use the PowerShell option which is in your menu by default.
* It is important to know where your files are stored (which directory are they in) . You will sometimes have multiple copies of a file or different files with the same name, so searching/finding is not a good option. Make a folder for your APCS work wherever you normally keep your school documents/files. You can make subdirectories for specific assignments/topics etc. When you need the terminal, make sure to open the correct folder with the terminal. There are ways to change which directory the terminal is working in, but you will learn about that in class.
