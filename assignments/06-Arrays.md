# Arrays
Arrays in Java are similar to Arrays in Javascript or lists in
Python. They are, however, more primitive.

Unlike in python, in java you have to declare variables with their types so while a Java
array can hold many items they all have to be of the same type. You
also have to specify the number of items an array can hold when you
create it.
